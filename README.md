Steam Chatroom Antiflood
====================

The purpose of this tool is to automatically kick problematic users from a Steam chatroom.

Users are considered problematic if they do the following things:

- Send the same messages over and over again
- Send a lot of messages in a short period of time (flood)

To customize how users detected, you may update the `settings.xml` file which is automatically created after the application is run for the first time.

In this XML file, you can also configure the application to notify you whenever specific keywords are mentionned in a chatroom.
